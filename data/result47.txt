She is best known for her shōjo manga series, particularly "Fushigi Yûgi," which gained significant popularity both in Japan and internationally.\n\n### Key Works:\n- **Fushigi Yûgi (The Mysterious Play)**: This series, which ran from May 1992 to June 1996, is one of her most famous works. It tells the story of two teenage girls, Miaka and Yui, who are transported into a mysterious book called "The Universe of the Four Gods." The series is heavily inspired by Chinese mythology and the four mythological creatures of China. "Fushigi Yûgi" was serialized in "Shōjo Comic" by Shogakukan and later published in 18 volumes. Viz Media released the manga in North America starting in 1999.\n\n### Career Challenges:\nWatase has faced significant challenges in her career as a manga artist. One particularly difficult period was while working on "Arata: The Legend." Her former editor continuously demanded redraws of scenes he did not like or understand. This constant pressure led to a cycle of late nights and redraws, causing Watase to lose her enthusiasm for the project. She found herself working solely to meet deadlines rather than for the enjoyment of creating for fans or the story itself.\n\n### Other Notable Works:\n- **Kaze to Ki no Uta (The Poem of Wind and Trees)**: A manga that explores themes of love and loss, set in a French boarding school.\n- **Buddy Complex**: A science fiction series that revolves around Aoba Watase, an ordinary high school boy who is suddenly involved in a battle with giant robots and transported to the future.\n\n### Personal Interests and Style:\nWatase\'s work often blends elements of fantasy, romance, and adventure, appealing to a wide audience. Her detailed artwork and intricate storylines have earned her a dedicated fan base both in Japan and internationally. She is known for her ability to create compelling characters and immersive worlds.\n\n### Legacy:\nYuu Watase\'s contributions to the manga industry have been significant, influencing a generation of manga artists and readers.
