She is the youngest of seven siblings. Her father, Nur Omar Mohamed, is a Somali and worked as a teacher trainer. Her mother was a Benadiri and passed away when Ilhan was a child. Following her mother's death, Ilhan was raised by her father and grandfather, Abukar, who was the director of Somalia's National Marine Transport. Many of her uncles and aunts also worked as civil servants.\n\n**Early Challenges and Migration:**\nDuring the Somali Civil War, Omar and her family fled the country. They spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before immigrating to the United States in 1995. They settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Omar eventually became an American citizen.\n\n**Education and Early Career:**\nOmar attended North High School in Minneapolis and later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from North Dakota State University. She also holds a Master of Public Affairs degree from the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs. Before entering politics, Omar worked as a community nutrition educator and later as a campaign manager for K.Callahan's Minneapolis City Council campaign in 2013.\n\n**Political Career:**\n- **Minnesota House of Representatives:**\n  In 2016, Omar was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, representing the 60B district. This made her the first Somali American elected to any state legislature in the United States.\n\n- **U.S. Congress:**\n  On November 6, 2018, Omar was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Minnesota's 5th congressional district. She became the first Somali American and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, alongside Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Omar is also the first woman of color to serve as a U.S. Representative from Minnesota.\n\n**Personal Life:**\nOmar has been married to Ahmed Hirsi. They initially had two children together and were legally divorced. In 2011, they reconciled and had a third child in 2012. They were legally married in 2018. Omar, Hirsi, and their three children live in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis.\n\n**Legacy and Impact:**\nIlhan Omar's journey from a refugee to a U.S. Representative is a testament to her resilience and dedication to public service. She has been a vocal advocate for progressive policies, including healthcare reform, environmental justice, and immigrant rights. Her presence in Congress has been significant in representing the voices of underrepresented communities and fostering greater diversity in American politics."], 'claims': [['There are no factual claims provided in this paragraph.', 'Ilhan Omar was born on October 4, 1981, in Mogadishu, Somalia.', 'Ilhan Omar is the youngest of seven siblings.', 'Nur Omar Mohamed is the father of Ilhan Omar and he is a Somali.', 'Nur Omar Mohamed worked as a teacher trainer.', "Ilhan Omar's mother was a Benadiri and passed away when Ilhan was a child.", "Following her mother's death, Ilhan Omar was raised by her father and grandfather, Abukar.", "Abukar, the grandfather of Ilhan Omar, was the director of Somalia's National Marine Transport.", "Many of Ilhan Omar's uncles and aunts worked as civil servants.", 'During the Somali Civil War, Omar and her family fled Somalia.', 'Omar and her family spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp.', 'Omar and her family immigrated to the United States in 1995.', 'Omar and her family settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Omar eventually became an American citizen.', 'Omar attended North High School in Minneapolis.', 'Omar earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from North Dakota State University.', "Omar holds a Master of Public Affairs degree from the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs.", 'Before entering politics, Omar worked as a community nutrition educator.', "Omar worked as a campaign manager for K.
