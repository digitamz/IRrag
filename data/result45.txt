Known by the nickname "The Iceman," Kuklinski is notorious for his method of freezing victims to obscure the time of death, earning him this chilling moniker.\n\n### Early Life\nKuklinski was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, to Polish immigrant parents, Stanisław "Stanley" Kukliński and Wanda Ciszewski. His father, a brakeman on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, was known for his harsh and abusive demeanor. Kuklinski\'s early life was marked by violence and neglect, which many believe contributed to his later criminal activities.\n\n### Criminal Career\nKuklinski began his criminal career at a young age, engaging in petty theft and violence. Over time, he developed into a professional hitman, working for various organized crime families, including the DeCavalcante crime family of Newark, New Jersey, and the Five Families of New York City. He was known for his efficiency and ruthlessness, earning the respect and fear of his peers and employers. Kuklinski was estimated to have killed at least several dozen people, both on the orders of crime bosses and on his own initiative.\n\n### Arrest and Trials\nKuklinski\'s criminal activities eventually caught up with him. In 1986, he was arrested and charged with multiple counts of murder. He was convicted of five murders and sentenced to five consecutive life sentences, making him ineligible for parole until the age of 110 (in the year 2045). This ensured he would spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\n### Incarceration and Interviews\nDuring his time in prison, Kuklinski granted numerous interviews to prosecutors, psychiatrists, criminologists, and writers. These interviews provided insight into his criminal mind and methods. HBO produced three documentaries about Kuklinski, airing in 1992, 2001, and 2003. The last documentary featured interviews conducted by renowned forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz. Two biographies, written by Anthony Bruno and Philip Carlo, further detailed Kuklinski\'s life and crimes. A feature film, "The Iceman," starring Michael Shannon, was also produced based on Kuklinski\'s life.\n\n### Death\nRichard Kuklinski died on March 5, 2006, in the infirmary of the Sussex County Correctional Facility in Newton, New Jersey, at the age of 70. His death marked the end of a notorious criminal career that had captivated and horrified the public for decades.\n\n### Legacy\nRichard Kuklinski\'s legacy is one of infamy. His brutal methods and the sheer number of his alleged victims have made him a subject of fascination for true crime enthusiasts and the entertainment industry. Despite his crimes, Kuklinski\'s life has been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and films, ensuring that his story continues to be told and studied.'], 'claims': [['Richard Leonard Kuklinski was born on April 11, 1935.', 'Richard Leonard Kuklinski died on March 5, 2006.', 'Richard Leonard Kuklinski was an American hitman and serial killer.', 'Richard Leonard Kuklinski operated primarily in the New Jersey and New York areas.', "Richard Leonard Kuklinski was known by the nickname 'The Iceman'.", 'Richard Leonard Kuklinski froze victims to obscure the time of death.', 'Kuklinski was born in Jersey City, New Jersey.', "Kuklinski's parents were Polish immigrants.", 'Kuklinski\'s father was named Stanisław "Stanley" Kukliński.', "Kuklinski's mother was named Wanda Ciszewski.", "Kuklinski's father was a brakeman on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad.", "Kuklinski's father was known for his harsh and abusive demeanor.", "Kuklinski's early life was marked by violence and neglect.", "Many believe that Kuklinski's early life contributed to his later criminal activities.", 'Kuklinski began his criminal career at a young age.', 'Kuklinski engaged in petty theft and violence at a young age.', 'Kuklinski developed into a professional hitman over time.', 'Kuklinski worked for various organized crime families.', 'Kuklinski worked for the DeCavalcante crime family of Newark, New Jersey.', 'Kuklinski worked for the Five Families of New York City.', 'Kuklinski was known for his efficiency and ruthlessness.', 'Kuklinski earned the respect and fear of his peers and employers.', 'Kuklinski was estimated to have killed at least several dozen people.', 'Kuklinski killed people on the orders of crime bosses.', 'Kuklinski killed people on his own initiative.', "Kuklinski's criminal activities eventually caught up with him.", 'Kuklinski was arrested and charged with multiple counts of murder in 1986.', 'Kuklinski was convicted of five murders.', 'Kuklinski was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences.', "Kuklinski's sentence made him ineligible for parole until the age of 110, in the year 2045.", 'Kuklinski would spend the rest of his life in prison.', 'Kuklinski granted numerous interviews to prosecutors, psychiatrists, criminologists, and writers during his time in prison.', "These interviews provided insight into Kuklinski's criminal mind and methods.", 'HBO produced three documentaries about Kuklinski, airing in 1992, 2001, and 2003.', 'The last HBO documentary about Kuklinski featured interviews conducted by renowned forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz.', 'Two biographies about Kuklinski were written by Anthony Bruno and Philip Carlo.', "A feature film titled 'The Iceman,' starring Michael Shannon, was produced based on Kuklinski's life.", 'Richard Kuklinski died on March 5, 2006.', 'Richard Kuklinski died in the infirmary of the Sussex County Correctional Facility.', 'The Sussex County Correctional Facility is located in Newton, New Jersey.', 'Richard Kuklinski died at the age of 70.', "Richard Kuklinski's death marked the end of a notorious criminal career.", "Richard Kuklinski's criminal career had captivated and horrified the public for decades.", "Richard Kuklinski's legacy is one of infamy.", "Richard Kuklinski's brutal methods have made him a subject of fascination for true crime enthusiasts and the entertainment industry.", "The sheer number of Richard Kuklinski's alleged victims has made him a subject of fascination for true crime enthusiasts and the entertainment industry.", "Richard Kuklinski's life has been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and films.", "Richard Kuklinski's story continues to be told and studied."]], 'claim_correctness': [array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
